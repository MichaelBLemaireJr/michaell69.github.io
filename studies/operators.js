/*
 ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=
 = is the basic assignment operator it assigns a variable to a value,
 += adds the following value to the value preseeding this operator then reassigns the new value to the previous variable
 -= does the same operation as += execpt subtracts instead of adds
 *= muiltiplies
 /= divides
 %= division remainder
*/

/*
ARITHMATIC OPERATORS: they do maths
+ adds
- subtracts
* multiplies
/ divides
% Modulus
++ increments by 1
-- Decrements by 1
*/

/*
COMPARISON OPERATORS: compares two values and returns a boolean on whether or not the comparison is true or not
=== hard comparson to see if the two values are exactly the same and checks the datatypes
== soft comparison to see if the two values are the same and doesn't check datatypes
!= checks if the two values are diffrent but doesn't check type
!== checks to see if the two values are diffent and does check type
> checks to see if the first value is greater in value than the second value
< checks if the first value is smaller than the second value
>= checks to see if the first value is greater than or equal to in value than the second value
<= if the first value is smaller than or equal to the second value
